                Following BMO's acquisition of Bank of the West, there was a strategic initiative to modernize and unify the wire transfer experience for U.S. clients. The goal was to reduce reliance on in-branch transactions and empower users with a seamless, self-service digital solution.

            <p>
              Reviewed existing West Coast customer behaviour and branch wire logs. Gathered insights from the existing business team to understand what they were trying to achieve with this new feature. At BMO, we used a template called Phase 0 which helped us gather important information from relevant stakeholders making sure that we were missing any important information.

          <ProcessStep number={2} title="Defining the Problem" bgColor="bg-blue-500">
            <p>
              Mapped current vs ideal-state user flows to reduce drop-off and confusion. I also added some common sentiments among users through the paths such as not trusting themselves when sending a large amount of money and adding incorrect information.

            <p>
              Designed multiple flows with clear instructions, progress indicators, and confirmation steps to increase user confidence. In this case, I like to present wireframes and mockups in separate meetings first focusing only on the UX and not looking into the UI so that I could understand that the journey was intuitive and so that then we could only focus on our UI and the existing design system.

              Ran usability tests to refine copy, error handling, and user guidance through the journey. Testing was short due to time constraints but we made sure to do the best with what we had.

              Using Figma, during our daily standups, I made sure to provide as much information to our developers in order to ensure visual consistency. This range from discussing existing design components to enhancing new components and even teaching them how to navigate Figma in dev mode.

          We successfully got to the goals we had at the beginning of this project. This project taught me how to work across complex, regulated environments while still advocating for simple, intuitive design. I learned how to break down a high-risk, high-friction task like wire transfers into digestible steps users feel confident completing. Collaborating with developers to ensure visual consistency and behaviour across devices also made me more thoughtful in how I document and support handoffs ‚Äî especially across a multiple stakeholders.
