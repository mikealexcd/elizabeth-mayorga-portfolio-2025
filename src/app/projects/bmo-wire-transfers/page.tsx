                Following BMO's acquisition of Bank of the West, there was a strategic initiative to modernize and unify the wire transfer experience for U.S. clients. The goal was to reduce reliance on in-branch transactions and empower users with a seamless, self-service digital solution.

            <p>
              Reviewed existing West Coast customer behaviour and branch wire logs. Gathered insights from the existing business team to understand what they were trying to achieve with this new feature. At BMO, we used a template called Phase 0 which helped us gather information from relevant stakeholders making sure that we weren't missing anything crucial.

            <p>
              Mapped current vs ideal-state user flows to reduce drop-off and confusion. I also added some common sentiments among users through the paths such as not trusting themselves when sending a large amount of money and adding incorrect information.

            <p>
              I designed multiple flows with clear instructions, progress indicators, and confirmation steps to increase user confidence. In this case, I preferred to present wireframes and mockups in separate meetings, initially focusing only on UX to ensure the user journey felt intuitive. This allowed us to later dedicate our attention to refining the UI and aligning it with the existing design system.

              Ran usability tests to refine copy, error handling, and user guidance through the journey. Testing was short due to time constraints, but we made sure to do the best with what we had.

              Using Figma, I regularly shared detailed design guidance during our daily standups to help ensure visual consistency.

          We successfully got to the goals we had at the beginning of this project. This project provided me with experience to how to work across complex, regulated environments while still advocating for simple, intuitive design. I learned how to break down a high-risk, high-friction task like wire transfers into digestible steps users feel confident completing.
